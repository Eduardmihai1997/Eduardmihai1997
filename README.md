- <b>Book Store website  </b>
  - Book Land is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. 

  -	Front End Technologies Used: Book Land utilizes React.js as its primary front-end development framework, along with HTML, Sass, and JavaScript to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. The front-end is built with Material UI, a UI library that enhances the design and functionality of the web application. 

 - Backend Technologies Used: Book Land uses Node.js and Express.js as its server-side framework and MongoDB as its database to store user information, such as login credentials and other user-related data.

  
- <b>Steganography application in C#</b>
  - A WPF application that enables users to hide a message within an image using steganography. Users can select an image, input a message, and then encode the message into the image.
